When you walk away
You don't hear me say
"Please, oh baby, don't go"
Simple and clean
Is the way that you're making me feel tonight
It's hard to let it go

You're giving me
Too many things
Lately
You're all I need (Oh, oh)
You smailed at me
And said
The daily things (like this and that and what is what?)
That keep us all
Busy are confusing me
That's when you came to me
And said
"Don't get me wrong I love you
But does that mean I have to meet
Your father?"

When we are older you'll understand
What I meant, when I said "No"
I don't think, life is quite that simple

When you walk away
You don't hear me say
"Please, oh baby, don't go"
Simple and clean
Is the way that you're making me feel tonight
It's hard to let it go

Hold me
Whatever lies beyond this morning
Is a little later on
Regardless of warnings
The future doesn't scare me at all
Nothing's like before

When you walk away
You don't hear me say
"Please, oh baby, don't go"
Simple and clean
Is the way that you're making me feel tonight
It's hard to let it go

Hold me
Whatever lies beyond this morning
Is a little later on
Regardless of warnings
The future doesn't scare me at all
Nothing's like before

Hold me
